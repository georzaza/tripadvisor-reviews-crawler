It is important to note that this crawler scripts will only work for enlish-language
reviews. That is because Tripadvisor changes the content of the webpage according to 
the language used. So, for example, when you want to get the reviews of a Restaurant,
make sure that you have selected to only see english comments.


## How to Run

You are advised to use Opera as your browsing client. That is why, on opera, there is
a built-in VPN service that you may run. You are advised to run it.

1. Go to a Tripadvisor page of a restaurant or a hotel.

2. Open Developer Tools.

3. Copy the contents of the appropriate script into either the 'Console' of the 
developer tools, or in the snippets. The last option is the best option.

4. Run it.

5. Happy crawling.


If you want to understand how the restaurant crawler works, look at the code of the 
hotel crawler, the code is similar for both crawlers, but the hotel crawler contains 
sufficient comments to explain it's functionality.


Give the project a star if you liked it.
